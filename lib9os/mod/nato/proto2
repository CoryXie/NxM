NatStar (NAT boxes in a Star configuration)

A bunch of Nat boxes talk to a single "Statebox".

Statebox 
	has the authoritative state table; 
	gets updates from each Nat box and copies them to all
		the other Nat boxes;
	decides when a NAT box is dead; takes over aging of
		connections originated by dead NAT box;
	
Statebox is a single point of failure.
To ameliorate this, 
	it can be buddied up;
	it can talk to other Stateboxes; the idea is to think of 
	groups of NAT boxes with one/more Stateboxes per group;
	groups can merge/split -- this is my first attempt at scaling.
	need to work out details.

Simple protocol.

Assuming a trusted connection between each NAT box and its
Statebox.


Some parameters:
	Update frequency: UF
	Deadline for recving (at Statebox) update message from box j: Rj
	Deadline for sending (from Statebox) update message to box j: Sj
	Cleanup frequency : CF
