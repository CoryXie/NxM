NatClique

NatClique assumes that every NAT box can talk to every other NAT box
over a TCP connection (the connection may be RUDP/UDP/something else;
for now, it is TCP).

Need a canonical NAT table -- hard to pin down as changes happen
at different times on different copies.

seed (long open connections) + updates; updates identified by 
(sender id, update #). has an identifying hash.

Some parameters:
	Update frequency: UF
	Deadline for recving (at box i) update message from box j: Rij
	Deadline for sending (from box i) update message to box j: Sij
	Cleanup frequency : CF

Message Header
	SenderId
	AuthInfo
	MesgId
	MesgType
	TimeStamp
	Body

MesgType:
	Auth, ReqTab, RepTab, Update, ReqAbAn, RepAbAn,  






NatStar

NatStar assumes that there is a "leader" and a "backup leader" 
and that every box talks to these two. The role of the backup
leader is to take over the leadership if the leader dies.
